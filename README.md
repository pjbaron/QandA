__To use:__

* Press "Load Q & A's..." and select a simple text file containing a set of questions and their corresponding answers
* Tick or clear the box "Random Order" (when unchecked the questions will be presented in the same order as the file)

* Press "Reveal Answer..." (or the Space-bar key) to see the answer to that question

There is no scoring - this is not a quiz program it is purely a memory training tool.

__Text file format:__

* Empty lines are ignored, use them to create groups of questions and answers for easier reading
* Questions must be on a single line
* Answers must be on a single (separate line)
* The tool assumes that every question has an answer in the file (it alternates non-empty lines as Q,A,Q,A)

Is this tool useful?
Yes, for a certain type of rote learning it can be very helpful.

How large is the executable file?
On my machine it builds to 14KB
Why isn't there an empty line above this question?
Because it isn't needed, empty lines are totally ignored but are not required.


Do we need a question mark after every question.
Nope.
